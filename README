SHELL GAME
==========

The [shell game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_game) is a type of street gambling where an operator hides an object (the pea) under a cup (or similar) and then shuffles the cup.

To win the player must correctly guess which cup hides the pea.

This project is an implementation of the shell game, written in CoffeeScript.
